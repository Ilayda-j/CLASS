In this iteration, we use the Unstructured File Loader, which cannot proccess .json files (the preferred format). We are working on finding a file loader that allows .json.

It can be used in a variety of ways, but most importantly, it can be used to identify patterns within their data that might not otherwise be identified by human beings. For example, it can understand customer behaviors, optimize logistics, and expand efficiencies throughout the business. Machine learning does not get tired, meaning it can work as long as you want it to. It can sift through massive amounts of data, that no human being can look through in an efficient manner. Machine learning can be used as a tool to identify anomalies when something needs to be checked to save or gain money. The predictions that companies gain from machine learning are cheap, accurate, and automate. These machine learning algorithms can be brought to larger scales to encompass the whole business and its operations. It is important to note, Machine learning is just predictions. Predictions to understand important patterns that could make or break a company since they understand the patterns of their business more. It is an amazing tool, but should be used wisely and carefully because if not, it can expensive, useless, and straight up wrong.'\n",

Overall, it gives the company of an overview about what would be the trend for their business industry, and analyze the customer behavior to help business segment their customers groups. Today, many companies have a vast amount of information generated by behavior, computer, events, people, and devices. This massive amount of data is difficult for human to handle, and even if human manages it, it is not profitable as human labor is expensive. Thanks to machine learning, companies can utilize their in-house or even third-party data to make something useful for their business. In medical analysis, for example, with human, it takes a very long time to find patterns in thousands of MRI scans. On the other hand, machines can detect patterns in seconds by entering data as long as the information is correctly labeled or trained properly. Another example would be segmenting customer group. In marketing department, the business could use unsupervised machine learning to cluster their customer segments to generate personalized contents that are relevant for each of individuals.'\n",

Business people only use ML to help themselves get intuitions of how decisions should be made and make predictions of results they might get based on their decisions. For example, if a business tries to launch a new product, it will use ML to test whether it will work or not on a small scale before it is introduced to a large scale. People called this step piloting. In this step, people collect data that is generated by using the pilot product and analyze their next move. They could tweak some features based on the feedback.

If the goal is well defined and repeatable, an algorithm can be trained to perform that task far faster than any human and often with more reliability. Because of this, businesses can implement machine learning algorithms to solve problems human labor was previously required for, whether that be mental or physical labor. Although implementing machine learning often has high initial costs, because computers do not require payment outside of maintaining their operation, in the long run companies can save money by either making their workers’ tasks more efficient or by entirely automating tasks. This increases the profit margins for those firms.'\n",

If they use some of the simple classification models with high accuracy, it will save them a lot of time on data cleaning and validation, which are kind of repetitive and time-consuming. For example, NLP provides an easy way for personnel to query business information, understand business processes, and discover new relationships between business data, ideas based on intuition and insight often emerge. Using models to do prediction helps people making wiser decision. Since models can handle way more data than human, newly collected data can feed in the model and get some predictive result as a reference to the decision makers. This is significant because in this industry, time is precious, and traders must decide quickly and precisely. A little negligence will lead to a big mistake, lose a lot of money, and even affect the company\"s reputation.

The at-risk children will subsequentially be taken into custody before their circumstance is evaluated and a decision about their future is reached. If a machine-learning algorithm were to replace the aforementioned social worker: the biggest concern would be when the algorithm outputs a false positive or false negative prediction. A false positive means that the children are said to be at risk while actually not and removed from their households. A false negative would be when some children are not removed from the dangerous household because the algorithm returned negative results. The costs of both incorrect decisions are too big for anyone to afford. Admittedly, data scientists might be able to develop a great algorithm with very low false positive and false negative rates, and that social workers can easily make the same amount of mistakes or more, but it is still too much for our humane society to take by putting such a life-changing or even life-or-death decision in a machine’s metaphorical hands.'\n",

For example, you can’t predict that the person behind you is texting while driving and is going to rear end you, or that a snowstorm can make you start to hydroplane on the road. So much of the process of learning is understanding the exceptions, such as driving in the rain, at night, or almost avoiding an accident.

The training of a machine learning model for diagnosing medical conditions requires a large dataset of medical records, along with labels indicating each diagnosis. But there are several barriers. First, medical records are often private and sensitive, and sharing them may raise legal and ethical concerns. Second, medical conditions are complicated, it’s hard to ensure the labels are correct, some of which may takes years or decades to testify. Even if they can recognize some pattern for some disease, symptoms vary from person to person. At a first glance, even after running some tests, it’s hard for doctors to tell the case.

Software is more common to do detection for now, but it can just recognize the intrusion pattern that already known or preset by the programmer. However, this can be accomplished by employing algorithms that can analyze large amounts of data and detect anomalies that may indicate an attempted intrusion. We can feed ML model with network traffic, labeled or not labeled, system logs to let it learn and identify unusual patterns or behavior. With well-learned models, we can use them to find out signs of unauthorized access or even malware. One of the greatest things is that ML model may be able to find some hidden pattern that human has not and predict how and when the intrusion will take place, or even figure out how the malware will function to attach.

After training the model by the letters Einstein wrote in the past decades, the model will have the same or similar personality as Einstein.

We know that certain retailers mark up prices for the items on their shelfs. Some items are more expensive in one location than others and often time, certain prices are not posted online.

To solve the problem, the algorithm will examine the user’s location and the item(s) that the user wants and output the best stores for the items. How this item work is that they take in data from all the closest stores, rank each item based on value, distance, and availability.

        "q5_B_answer_2 = 'Natural gas consumption has rebounded in the last year, with economic recovery and increased extreme weather leading to increased demand for natural gas, resulting in a tight market and soaring prices. Gas supply agencies want to use ML to predict the deliverability of natural gas storage in depleted reservoirs. First, natural gas is most commonly stored in underground formations: 1) depleted reservoirs, 2) aquifers, and 3) salt caverns. A depleted reservoir must have some elements of a good oil and gas formation to be converted to a subsurface natural gas reservoir, such as good porosity and permeability, the presence of good seal rock, and the presence of cap rock. I think this thing can be achieved with ML because there is a huge amount of data collected from natural gas extraction sites around the world since 1915, and this data provides a good basis and realizability for our research. We can test and build models from this data so that we can use ML to make predictions.'\n",
