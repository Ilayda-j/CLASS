It can be used in a variety of ways, but most importantly, it can be used to identify patterns within their data that might not otherwise be identified by human beings. For example, it can understand customer behaviors, optimize logistics, and expand efficiencies throughout the business. Machine learning does not get tired, meaning it can work as long as you want it to. It can sift through massive amounts of data, that no human being can look through in an efficient manner. Machine learning can be used as a tool to identify anomalies when something needs to be checked to save or gain money. The predictions that companies gain from machine learning are cheap, accurate, and automate. These machine learning algorithms can be brought to larger scales to encompass the whole business and its operations. It is important to note, Machine learning is just predictions. Predictions to understand important patterns that could make or break a company since they understand the patterns of their business more. It is an amazing tool, but should be used wisely and carefully because if not, it can expensive, useless, and straight up wrong.'\n",

Overall, it gives the company of an overview about what would be the trend for their business industry, and analyze the customer behavior to help business segment their customers groups. Today, many companies have a vast amount of information generated by behavior, computer, events, people, and devices. This massive amount of data is difficult for human to handle, and even if human manages it, it is not profitable as human labor is expensive. Thanks to machine learning, companies can utilize their in-house or even third-party data to make something useful for their business. In medical analysis, for example, with human, it takes a very long time to find patterns in thousands of MRI scans. On the other hand, machines can detect patterns in seconds by entering data as long as the information is correctly labeled or trained properly. Another example would be segmenting customer group. In marketing department, the business could use unsupervised machine learning to cluster their customer segments to generate personalized contents that are relevant for each of individuals.'\n",

Business people only use ML to help themselves get intuitions of how decisions should be made and make predictions of results they might get based on their decisions. For example, if a business tries to launch a new product, it will use ML to test whether it will work or not on a small scale before it is introduced to a large scale. People called this step piloting. In this step, people collect data that is generated by using the pilot product and analyze their next move. They could tweak some features based on the feedback.

If the goal is well defined and repeatable, an algorithm can be trained to perform that task far faster than any human and often with more reliability. Because of this, businesses can implement machine learning algorithms to solve problems human labor was previously required for, whether that be mental or physical labor. Although implementing machine learning often has high initial costs, because computers do not require payment outside of maintaining their operation, in the long run companies can save money by either making their workersâ€™ tasks more efficient or by entirely automating tasks. This increases the profit margins for those firms.'\n",

If they use some of the simple classification models with high accuracy, it will save them a lot of time on data cleaning and validation, which are kind of repetitive and time-consuming. For example, NLP provides an easy way for personnel to query business information, understand business processes, and discover new relationships between business data, ideas based on intuition and insight often emerge. Using models to do prediction helps people making wiser decision. Since models can handle way more data than human, newly collected data can feed in the model and get some predictive result as a reference to the decision makers. This is significant because in this industry, time is precious, and traders must decide quickly and precisely. A little negligence will lead to a big mistake, lose a lot of money, and even affect the company\"s reputation.
